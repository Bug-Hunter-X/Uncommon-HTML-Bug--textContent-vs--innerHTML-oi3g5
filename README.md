This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to manipulating HTML content using `textContent` vs. `innerHTML`. The `bug.html` file shows incorrect usage of `textContent` leading to unexpected behavior when dealing with elements containing HTML content within the text. The correct approach is shown in `bugSolution.html` using `innerHTML`. The difference is highlighted in the comments within the script tag.
